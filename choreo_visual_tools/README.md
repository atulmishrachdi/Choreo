# Choreo Visual Tools

Helper functions for displaying (and debugging) Choreo's assembly sequence, input EE candidate poses and other input geometries. This package is built in top of [rviz_visual_tools](https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/rviz_visual_tools) and acts like a simplified and customized version of [moveit_rviz_tools](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_visual_tools).

Developed by [Yijiang Huang](http://digitalstructures.mit.edu/page/about#huang) at the Digital Structures Research Group, MIT with outside contributors.
